    <a class="anchor" name="Chapter 4">Chapter 4</a><b>Chapter 4 - Motherboards</b><br>
    The motherboard is a circuit board that connects all of the various components of they system together.
    Included on the motherboard are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The socket for the processor</li>
      <li>Northbridge and Southbridge chips</li>
      <li>The BIOS chip(s) and battery</li>
      <li>DIMM slots for memory sticks</li>
      <li>Expansion slots for things like video, sound, and network cards</li>
      <li>The socket for the hard disk drive or solid state drive</li>
      <li>The socket for the power supply</li>
      <li>The socket for the optical drive</li>
      <li>The socket(s) for the fan(s)
      <li>Various input/output ports including USB, audio, video, and ethernet</li>
    </ul>
    Motherboards come in a variety of different sizes which are, ordered from largest to smallest, the ATX, microATX,
    FlexATX, and Mini-ITX. These sizes dictate what size case can be used, with anything being able to fit in a case designed
    for a full-sized ATX board but with a case designed for a Mini-ITX only being able to use a Mini-ITX board.
    As long as the motherboard is not too large, any board size can fit into an appropriate case because all standard 
    motherboards attach to the case via the same layout of screws.<br>
    <br>
  
    <a class="anchor" name="Chapter 5">Chapter 5</a><b>Chapter 5 - BIOS</b><br>
    BIOS, which stands for Basic Input/Output System and is also known as device drivers or just drives, is the software 
    that serves as the bridge between the hardware and the operating system. When the computer is powered on, BIOS is what 
    gives the processor its first instructions, checks that all components are functioning (Power On Start Test or POST), 
    allowing the operating system to be loaded and take over.<br>
    Physically, BIOS is stored on a chip of non-volatile read-only memory (more on this in the next chapter) attached 
    directly to the motherboard. It is important and perhaps counter-intuitive to note that while the BIOS itself has a 
    manufacturer, any updates or upgrades must be gotten through the manufacturer of the motherboard. This is because 
    the BIOS chip runs a custom version designed to run specifically with that motherboard.<br>
    <br>
    
    <a class="anchor" name="Chapter 6">Chapter 6 - Memory</a><b>Chapter 6 - Memory</b><br>
    Memory is what holds onto data and comes in a variety of different types. The first important distinction is whether or 
    not that memory is volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memory dumps all data when it loses power, such as caches and main 
    memory sticks, while non-volatile memory holds onto it despite being the lack of power, such as flash memory and hard 
    drives. <br>

    <a class="anchor" name="Bonus">Bonus</a><b>Bonus Section - Binary and Hexadecimal</b><br>
    Many people already know that information used by computers is, "a bunch of 1's and 0's," 
    but what, exactly, does that mean?<br>
    <br>
    Firstly, an explanation of a number system that you probably already know.<br>
    <br>
    For the most part, human civilizations use a base-10 numbering system (decimal). This means 
    that they count with 10 symbols:<br>
    <br>
    <center>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9</center><br>
    <br>
    After 9, another place value is added.<br>
    <br>
    <center><u>1</u>0<sub>10</sub></sub></center><br>
    <br>
    Place values can also be thought of as exponents, where the one's place is represented as 
    10<sup>0</sup>, the ten's place is 10<sup>1</sup>, the one-hundred's place as 10<sup>2</sup>, etc.<br>
    <br>
    Computers use a base-2 numbering system (binary) because transistors (and the much older tubes) have two states, 
    off and on, which can be represented by 0 and 1, respectively. After 1, another place value is added. In 
    computing terms, each place value is a bit.<br>
    <br>
    <center><u>1</u>0<sub>2</sub></sub></center><br>
    <br>
    Like with base-10, each place value can be thought of as exponents, where the first place is represented as 
    2<sup>0</sup>, the second place as 2<sup>1</sup>, the third place as 2<sup>2</sup>, the fourth as 2<sup>3</sup>, etc. 
    Because a byte is only eight place values or bits, we really only need to know up to 2<sup>7</sup>, or 128.<br>
    <br>
    With this information, converting between binary and decimal is fairly straight forward. 
    Converting from binary to decimal is as simple as basic addition.<br>
    <br>
    For example, let's look at the value 1011<sub>2</sub>. Every place value that contains a 1 can be converted 
    to its equivilent exponent and then added together to get the decimal equivilant. So, from left to right, 
    8 in the first place value, nothing in the second, 2 in the third, and 1 in the fourth.<br>
    <br>
    <center>1011<sub>2</sub> = 8<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 2<sub>10</sub> + 1<sub>10</sub> = 
    11<sub>10</sub></center><br>
    <br>
    As another example:<br>
    <br>
    <center>100011<sub>2</sub> = 32<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 2<sub>10</sub> 
    + 1<sub>10</sub> = 35<sub>10</sub></center><br>
    <br>
    Converting from decimal to binary requires a bit more thought, but still just basic arithmetic. This time we'll
    be subtracting while using base-2 place value exponents as a checklist.<br>
    <br>
    For example, 13<sub>10</sub>. The first exponent that can go into 13<sub>10</sub> is 2<sup>3</sup>, or 
    8<sub>10</sub>. This leaves 5<sub>10</sub> which contains 2<sup>2</sup> or 4<sub>10</sub> and leaves only 
    1. As such, we can convert these exponents to 1101.<br>
    <br>
    <center>13<sub>10</sub> = 2<sup>3</sup> or 8<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>2</sup> or 4<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>0</sup> or 
    1 = 1101<sub>2</sub></center><br>
    <br>
    As another example:<br>
    <br>
    <center>213<sub>10</sub> = 2<sup>7</sup> or 128<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>6</sup> or 64<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>4</sup> 
    or 16<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>2</sup> or 4<sub>10</sub> + 1 = 11010101<sub>2</sub></center><br>
    <br>
    A long stream of 1's and 0's is difficult to work with, however. Thankfully, we can use another base-16 number system 
    (hexadecimal) to make strings of binary easier to work with. As a base-16 numbering system, hexadeximal uses 16 
    characters to count.<br>
    <br>
    <center>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F</center><br>
    <br>
    What makes hexadecimal easy is that, like with binary, each place value can be expressed as an exponent of 2, with the 
    first place value in hexadecimal being 2<sup>0</sup>, the second being 2<sup>4</sup>, the third being 2<sup>8</sup>, and 
    so on. This corresponds to every four place values in binary being equal to a single place value in hexadecimal. As such 
    we just need to break the binary number up into four-bit chunks, figure out what that chunk is in decimal, and then 
    match that to the corresponding hexadecimal character.<br>
    <br>
    For example, 1110<sub>2</sub> is the equivilant of 14<sub>10</sub> which is the equivilant of E<sub>16</sub>.<br>
    <br>
    As another longer example, 10110010<sub>2</sub> can be broken into two chunks, 1011<sub>2</sub> and 0010<sub>2</sub>, 
    which are 11<sub>10</sub> and 2<sub>10</sub>, respectively, giving us the hexadecimal number B2<sub>16</sub>.<br>
    <br>
    We can go in reverse just as easily.<br>
    <center>CD<sub>16</sub> = 12<sub>10</sub> | 13<sub>10</sub> = 1100<sub>2</sub> | 1101<sub>2</sub> = 11001101<sub>2</sub>
    </center><br>
    <br>
    Note: While we use base-10 numbers to easily convert hexadecimal to binary, those base-10 numbers are just placeholders 
    and are not the solution to converting hexadecimal to decimal (i.e. CD<sub>16</sub> is not equal to 1213<sub>10</sub>). 
    However, they are still the first step to converting to decimal. The second step is to multiply each value by its 
    respective place value exponent. So in the example of CD<sub>16</sub>, the first value, C<sub>16</sub>, occupies the 
    2<sup>4</sup> place value and the second value, D<sub>16</sub>, occupies the 2<sup>0</sup> place value. Thus:<br>
    <br>
    <center>CD<sub>16</sub> = 12<sub>10</sub> * 2<sup>4</sup> + 13<sub>10</sub> * 2<sup>0</sup> = 192<sub>10</sub> + 
    13<sub>10</sub> = 205<sub>10</sub></center><br>
    <br>
    To convert decimal to hexadecimal, we just need to divide repeatedly by 16, making note of whatever the remainder may 
    be, until a quotient less than 16 is reached. The remainders and final quotient are switched to their hexadecimal 
    equivilants, then arranged in the order they were found, with the last quotient being in the last place. This number 
    is then reversed, resulting in the final hexadecimal number.<br>
    <br>
    For example: 4879<sub>10</sub><br>
    <br>
    <center>4879 / 16 = 304 with a remainder of 15<sub>10</sub> or F<sub>16</sub></center><br>
    <br>
    <center>304 / 16 = 19 with a remainder of 0</center><br>
    <br>
    <center> 19 / 16 = 1 with a remainder of 3</center><br>
    <br>
    <center>F 0 3 1</center><br>
    <br>
    <center>Thus: 4879<sub>10</sub> = 130F<sub>16</sub></center><br>
    <br>
    Alternatively, you can just set a calculator to programmer mode and switch between the different bases with ease, 
    completely ignoring everything that's been said here.
