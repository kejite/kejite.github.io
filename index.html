      does the email and the Facebooks. However, when broken down they're actually not that difficult to understand.

      <b>Bonus Section - Binary and Hexadecimal</b><br>
      Many people already know that information used by computers is, "a bunch of 1's and 0's," 
      but what, exactly, does that mean?<br>
      <br>
      Firstly, an explanation of a number system that you probably already know.<br>
      <br>
      For the most part, human civilizations use a base-10 numbering system (decimal). This means 
      that they count with 10 symbols:<br>
      <br>
      <center>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9</center><br>
      <br>
      After 9, another place value is added.<br>
      <br>
      <center><u>1</u>0<sub>10</sub></sub></center><br>
      <br>
      Place values can also be thought of as exponents, where the one's place is represented as 
      10<sup>0</sup>, the ten's place is 10<sup>1</sup>, the one-hundred's place as 10<sup>2</sup>, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Computers use a base-2 numbering system (binary) because transistors (and the much older tubes) have two states, 
      off and on, which can be represented by 0 and 1, respectively. After 1, another place value is added. In 
      computing terms, each place value is a bit.<br>
      <br>
      <center><u>1</u>0<sub>2</sub></sub></center><br>
      <br>
      Like with base-10, each place value can be thought of as exponents, where the first place is represented as 
      2<sup>0</sup>, the second place as 2<sup>1</sup>, the third place as 2<sup>2</sup>, the fourth as 2<sup>3</sup>, etc. 
      Because a byte is only eight place values or bits, we really only need to know up to 2<sup>7</sup>, or 128 
      (more on this later).<br>
      <br>
      With this information, converting between binary and decimal is fairly straight forward. 
      Converting from binary to decimal is as simple as basic addition.<br>
      <br>
      For example, let's look at the value 1011<sub>2</sub>. Every place value that contains a 1 can be converted 
      to its equivilent exponent and then added together to get the decimal equivilant. So, from left to right, 
      8 in the first place value, nothing in the second, 2 in the third, and 1 in the fourth.<br>
      <br>
      <center>1011<sub>2</sub> = 8<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 2<sub>10</sub> + 1<sub>10</sub> = 
      11<sub>10</sub></center><br>
      <br>
      As another example:<br>
      <br>
      <center>100011<sub>2</sub> = 32<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 0<sub>10</sub> + 2<sub>10</sub> 
      + 1<sub>10</sub> = 35<sub>10</sub></center><br>
      <br>
      Converting from decimal to binary requires a bit more thought, but still just basic arithmetic. This time we'll
      be subtracting while using base-2 place value exponents as a checklist.<br>
      <br>
      For example, 13<sub>10</sub>. The first exponent that can go into 13<sub>10</sub> is 2<sup>3</sup>, or 
      8<sub>10</sub>. This leaves 5<sub>10</sub> which contains 2<sup>2</sup> or 4<sub>10</sub> and leaves only 
      1. As such, we can convert these exponents to 1101.<br>
      <br>
      <center>13<sub>10</sub> = 2<sup>3</sup> or 8<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>2</sup> or 4<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>0</sup> or 
      1 = 1101<sub>2</sub></center><br>
      <br>
      As another example:<br>
      <br>
      <center>213<sub>10</sub> = 2<sup>7</sup> or 128<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>6</sup> or 64<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>4</sup> 
      or 16<sub>10</sub> + 2<sup>2</sup> or 4<sub>10</sub> + 1 = 11010101<sub>2</sub></center><br>
      <br>
      A long stream of 1's and 0's is difficult to work with, however. Thankfully, we can use another base-16 number system 
      (hexadecimal) to make strings of binary easier to work with. As a base-16 numbering system, hexadeximal uses 16 
      characters to count.<br>
      <br>
      <center>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F</center><br>
      <br>
      What makes hexadecimal easy is that, like with binary, each place value can be expressed as an exponent of 2, with the 
      first place value in hexadecimal being 2<sup>0</sup>, the second being 2<sup>4</sup>, the third being 2<sup>8</sup>, and 
      so on. This corresponds to every four place values in binary being equal to a single place value in hexadecimal. As such 
      we just need to break the binary number up into four-bit chunks, figure out what that chunk is in decimal, and then 
      match that to the corresponding hexadecimal character.<br>
      <br>
      For example, 1110<sub>2</sub> is the equivilant of 14<sub>10</sub> which is the equivilant of E<sub>16</sub>.<br>
      <br>
      As another longer example, 10110010<sub>2</sub> can be broken into two chunks, 1011<sub>2</sub> and 0010<sub>2</sub>, 
      which are 11<sub>10</sub> and 2<sub>10</sub>, respectively, giving us the hexadecimal number B2<sub>16</sub>.<br>
      <br>
      We can go in reverse just as easily.<br>
      <center>CD<sub>16</sub> = 12<sub>10</sub> | 13<sub>10</sub> = 1100<sub>2</sub> | 1101<sub>2</sub> = 11001101<sub>2</sub>
      </center><br>
      <br>
      Note: While we use base-10 numbers to easily convert hexadecimal to binary, those base-10 numbers are just placeholders 
      and are not the solution to converting hexadecimal to decimal (i.e. CD<sub>16</sub> is not equal to 1213<sub>10</sub>). 
      However, they are still the first step to converting to decimal. The second step is to multiply each value by its 
      respective place value exponent. So in the example of CD<sub>16</sub>, the first value, C<sub>16</sub>, occupies the 
      2<sup>4</sup> place value and the second value, D<sub>16</sub>, occupies the 2<sup>0</sup> place value. Thus:<br>
      <br>
      <center>CD<sub>16</sub> = 12<sub>10</sub> * 2<sup>4</sup> + 13<sub>10</sub> * 2<sup>0</sup> = 192<sub>10</sub> + 
      13<sub>10</sub> = 205<sub>10</sub></center>
